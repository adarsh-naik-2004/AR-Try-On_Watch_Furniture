# AR based Watch and Furniture Try On

This project aims to bridge the gap between marker-based watch try-on and marker-less interior design by developing an integrated Augmented Reality (AR) application. The goal is to provide users with a seamless and user-friendly experience for accurately trying on watches and visualizing interior design changes in their actual living spaces.


## Features

- **Accurate Watch Placement:** Utilize marker-based AR technology to ensure precise placement and visualization of virtual watches on the user's wrist.
- **Furniture Placement:** Virtual placement of furniture and decor items in real-time using Vuforia AR camera technology.
- **Scalability:** The project is designed to be easily expandable and customizable for various applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls for seamless navigation and interaction within the AR environment.
